To get begin searching your data, you first have to create a corpus. A corpus is
a container where you upload all your data to be indexed and grouped together in
a single location for querying.

1.  To get started, navigate to the [Console Overview](https://console.vectara.com/overview).

2.  On the left sidebar, you'll see a **Copora** section. Click on it. This will
    open an overview of the corpora you have created. It will be empty if this
    is your first time accessing the console.
